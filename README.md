# datascience-docker

Containers and material for the Accel.ai Demystifying Deep Learning and AI Workshop July 21st - 23rd, 2017.

## Introduction ##

If you haven't used Docker before, a good place to start is the [Docker User Guide](https://docs.docker.com/userguide/).

### Setup ###

For those running a *linux* distro, you should be able to _apt-get/yum docker_. 

For those on *OS X*, you'll need to check out [Docker for Mac](https://www.docker.com/docker-mac)

For those on *Windows*, you'll want to go to [Docker for Windows](https://www.docker.com/docker-windows)

## Getting Started ##

The Miniconda3-based image is hosted at the Docker Hub. You can grab it:

```
docker pull accelai/datascience-base
```

The README.md in datascience-base/ gives an overview of how to use that image to run a container locally, and start a Jupyter server for Notebooks.
